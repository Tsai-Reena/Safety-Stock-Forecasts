### Cause
In order to solve the problem that enterprises could not predict the amount of inventory which should be stored in advance, we developed a safety stock forecast model to analyze the amount of safety stock that needs to be prepared on the production line.

### Features
In our project project, we used Multivariate Bi-LSTM to build the model: We used the neural network model to predict the sequence, instead of the experience to determine the supplier's policy and successfully.
